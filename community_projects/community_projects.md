# Community Projects

**Welcome to our Community Projects**! 🎉
Here, you’ll find all our awesome community examples, based on **Hailo** and **Raspberry Pi** and we’d love for you to contribute too! 🚀
Check out how you can get involved and share your own creations here:
[How to Add a Community Project](../doc/contributing-community-project.md)


## WLED display controller
This project provides a Python interface for controlling WLED-based LED matrix displays, with specific integration for Hailo AI pipelines. It enables real-time visualization of AI processing results on LED matrices, making it perfect for interactive AI demonstrations and visual feedback systems.

For more information see [WLED display project.](wled_display/README.md)

## Fruit Ninja

A real-time Fruit Ninja game that uses hand tracking through pose estimation to slice fruits. The game integrates with Hailo's pose estimation pipeline and runs a separate pygame process for the game logic.

For more information see [Fruit Ninja project.](fruit_ninja/README.md)

## TAILO
A smart device that keeps pets happy, active, and monitored through tracking and interactive play.

For more information see [TAILO Example Documentation.](TAILO/README.md)

## TEMPO

TEMPO brings **biofeedback AI music generation** to the edge, dynamically creating music based on **heart rate**.

For more information see [TEMPO Example Documentation.](TEMPO/README.md)


## Dynamic Captioning

Image captioning with **Florence2** on Hailo8 (26TOPS).
Not all the pipeline is accelerated on Hailo however porting a big part of it allows for a major speed up.
The latent space is monitored and caption is updated only when the scene changes.

## NavigAItor

A robot that autonomously navigates using visual landmarks (no GPS or Gyro).
