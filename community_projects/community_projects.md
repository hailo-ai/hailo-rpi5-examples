**Welcome to our Community Projects**! ðŸŽ‰
Here, youâ€™ll find all our awesome community examples, based on **Hailo** and **Raspberry Pi** and weâ€™d love for you to contribute too! ðŸš€
Check out how you can get involved and share your own creations here:

For more information see [TEMPO Example Documentation.](TEMPO/README.md)


## Dynamic Captioning

Image captioning with **Florence2** on Hailo8 (26TOPS).
Not all the pipeline is accelerated on Hailo however porting a big part of it allows for a major speed up.
The latent space is monitored and caption is updated only when the scene changes.
