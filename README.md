# Hailo Raspberry Pi 5 Examples

Welcome to the Hailo Raspberry Pi 5 Examples repository. This project showcases various examples demonstrating the capabilities of the Hailo AI processor on a Raspberry Pi 5. These examples will help you get started with AI on embedded devices.
The examples in this repository are designed to work with the Raspberry Pi AI Kit and AI HAT, supporting both the Hailo8 (26 TOPS) and Hailo8L (13 TOPS) AI processors. The examples can also be run on an x86_64 Ubuntu machine with the Hailo8/8L AI processor.
Visit the [Hailo Official Website](https://hailo.ai/) and [Hailo Community Forum](https://community.hailo.ai/) for more information.

## Install Hailo Hardware and Software Setup on Raspberry Pi

For instructions on how to set up Hailo's hardware and software on the Raspberry Pi 5, see the [Hailo Raspberry Pi 5 installation guide](doc/install-raspberry-pi5.md#how-to-set-up-raspberry-pi-5-and-hailo).


# Hailo RPi5 Basic Pipelines
The basic pipelines examples demonstrate object detection, human pose estimation, and instance segmentation, providing a solid foundation for your own projects.
This repo is using our new [Hailo Apps Infra](https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailo-apps-infra) repo as a dependency.
See our Developement Guide for more information on how to use the pipelines to create your own custom pipelines.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailo-rpi5-examples.git
```
Navigate to the repository directory:
```bash
cd hailo-rpi5-examples
```

### Installation
Run the following script to automate the installation process:
```bash
./install.sh
```

### Documentation
For additional information and documentation on how to use the pipelines to create your own custom pipelines, see the [Basic Pipelines Documentation](doc/basic-pipelines.md).

### Running The Examples
When opening a new terminal session, ensure you have sourced the environment setup script:
```bash
source setup_env.sh
```
### Detection Example

![Detection Example](doc/images/detection.gif)

#### Run the simple detection example:
```bash
python basic_pipelines/detection_simple.py
```
To close the application, press `Ctrl+C`.

This is lightweight version of the detection example, mainly focusing on demonstrating Hailo performance while minimizing CPU load. The internal GStreamer video processing pipeline is simplified by minimizing video processing tasks, and the YOLOv6 Nano model is used.

#### Run the full detection example:
This is the full detection example, including object tracker and multiple video resolution support - see more information [Detection Example Documentation](doc/basic-pipelines.md#detection-example):

```bash
python basic_pipelines/detection.py
```
To close the application, press `Ctrl+C`.

#### Running with Raspberry Pi Camera input:
```bash
python basic_pipelines/detection.py --input rpi
```

#### Running with USB camera input (webcam):
There are 2 ways:

Specify the argument `--input` to `usb`:
```bash
python basic_pipelines/detection.py --input usb
```

This will automatically detect the available USB camera (if multiple are connected, it will use the first detected).

Second way:

Detect the available camera using this script:
```bash
get-usb-camera
```
Run example using USB camera input - Use the device found by the previous script:
```bash
python basic_pipelines/detection.py --input /dev/video<X>
```

For additional options, execute:
```bash
python basic_pipelines/detection.py --help
```

#### Retrained Networks Support
This application includes support for using retrained detection models. For more information, see [Using Retrained Models](doc/basic-pipelines.md#using-retrained-models).

### Pose Estimation Example
For more information see [Pose Estimation Example Documentation.](doc/basic-pipelines.md#pose-estimation-example)
![Pose Estimation Example](doc/images/pose_estimation.gif)

#### Run the pose estimation example:
```bash
python basic_pipelines/pose_estimation.py
```
To close the application, press `Ctrl+C`.
See Detection Example above for additional input options examples.

### Instance Segmentation Example
For more information see [Instance Segmentation Example Documentation.](doc/basic-pipelines.md#instance-segmentation-example)
![Instance Segmentation Example](doc/images/instance_segmentation.gif)

#### Run the instance segmentation example:
```bash
python basic_pipelines/instance_segmentation.py
```
To close the application, press `Ctrl+C`.
See Detection Example above for additional input options examples.

### Depth Estimation Example
For more information see [Depth Estimation Example Documentation.](doc/basic-pipelines.md#depth-estimation-example)
![Depth Estimation Example](doc/images/depth.gif)

#### Run the depth estimation example:
```bash
python basic_pipelines/depth.py
```
To close the application, press `Ctrl+C`.
See Detection Example above for additional input options examples.

# Additional Examples and Resources

![Hailo Examples Code Structure](doc/images/hailo_examples_code_structure.svg)

## Hailo Apps Infra
Hailo RPi5 Examples are using the [Hailo Apps Infra Repository](https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailo-apps-infra) as a dependency. The Hailo Apps Infra repository contains the infrastructure of Hailo applications and pipelines.
It is aimed for to provide tools for developers who want to create their own custom pipelines and applications. It features a simple and easy-to-use API for creating custom pipelines and applications.
It it installed as a pip package and can be used as a dependency in your own projects. See more information in its documentation and Development Guide.

### CLIP Application

CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) predicts the most relevant text prompt on real-time video frames using Hailo8/8l AI processor.
See the [hailo-CLIP Repository](https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailo-CLIP) for more information.
